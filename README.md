# Popular Movies App

Project is a part of the Android Developer Nanodegree program at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801).

### Project Overview

The Popular Movies app shows the user a selection of "most popular" or "top rated" movies from themoviedb.org.

When the user opens up the app they will be presented with a list of 20 popular movies.  The user has the ability to change between "popular movies" and "top rated" movies.  The user also has the option to save their favorite movies in a database so they can view them at any time.

When a user clicks on a specific movie poster on the main screen of the app, they are taken to a detail page where they will see:

-The Movie Title <br/>
-The Movie Poster <br/>
-A heart icon (used to favorite a movie) <br/>
-The Movie Release Date <br/>
-The User Rating <br/>
-A Plot Summary <br/>
-Movie Trailers <br/>
-Movie Reviews <br/>
